# Introduction

## About

<br>

Naked UI is a minimalist, lightweight & modular UI library. It includes only essential components that are always needed in any type of Graphic User Interface. It can be used directly in a project or as a base for custom UI library.

<br>

## CSS-first

<br>

All components are deisgned with CSS-first approach. **Anything that can be handled without use of JavaScript is done this way.**

## Principles

1. HTML-native & CSS-first solutions
2. Easy to modify
3. Easy to style
4. Easy to animate
5. Accessible
6. Small package size
7. Optimized JS & CSS without any redundant code
8. As little CSS as possible outside of Naked UI Components to style them
